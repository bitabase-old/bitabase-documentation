This week I've tried to focus mainly on branding and integration, which involved updating the documentation, giving a more unified experiance.

## Documentation
I've been using Docusaurous for a while. My main reason was for something quick and simple so I could focus on the main product. However, I ended up struggling for a day trying to get the Bitabase header onto the site, while also keeping it statically built.

In the end I decided to scrap Docusaurous and write my own javascript static builder. This seems to be working, is very minimal and loads fast.

## Integration
I've published the new branded site and made the docuementation and blog feel more integrated with the site. They are still on different domains, but this should be almost seemless to the user.

The new client has all the business logic from the old UI, but I've only mapped up the login and join pages.

There is still no server up and running, so the bitabase.com website will still not work for a while. I'm planning on bringing up a small database server on render, but it won't be able to handle much load. It'll just be a small 1 cpu 1024 memory box, which should be good enough for demos and experimenting.

However, at this stage, anyone can install the [latest bitabase release](https://github.com/bitabase/bitabase/releases) then clone and start the bitabase-client.
