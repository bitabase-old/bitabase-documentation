<p><img src="/img/blog-assets/stressed.png" alt="stressed screenshot" title="stressed screenshot"></p>
<p>This is a tool that will run a series of integration tests at a rate you specify to see how far you can push the database.</p>
<p>Unfortunatly the results this weekend have not been impressive, although I haven&#39;t looked into the reason why this is slow yet.</p>
<p>I expect the rqlite stuff to be a bit slow, since it&#39;s a replicated database that is strongly consistent for metadata. This means there is always going to be a somewhat upper limit of how many databases and collections you can create. I was able to create around 250 databases a second on my machine, which I&#39;m happyish about. In the future I would want to test this can vertically scale by increasing the machine size.</p>
<p>However I would expect that writing records should be a lot better than 100 per second. This is unacceptably slow.</p>
<p>Again, I haven&#39;t been able to research why it&#39;s going so slow, but some thoughts:</p>
<ol>
<li>SQLite is normally not very good (although better than this) at inserting records one at a time. An option may be to batch all writes received within a small timeframe (100ms) then insert them at the same time.</li>
<li>This is running in docker on the same machine I&#39;m running the stress tests.</li>
<li>I haven&#39;t scaled horiontally. This was only on a &quot;cluster&quot; with one server node.</li>
<li>This sucks. I was really hoping for a few thousand writes per second per node.</li>
</ol>
<p>We&#39;re down but not out. Now we have the stress testing tool in place, I can leave that running and tweak settings and debug the services to try and find out what the bottleneck is.</p>
<p>On top of the stress testing, some bugs have been fixed. The gateway and manager were crashing when no servers had been discovered yet. Now it returns a 500 to the client, and logs an error to the console.</p>
<p>That&#39;s it for now!</p>
